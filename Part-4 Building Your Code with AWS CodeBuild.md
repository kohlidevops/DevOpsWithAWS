#🚀 Getting Started with AWS CodeBuild: A Beginner-Friendly Guide

Are you new to AWS CodeBuild and wondering how it fits into your CI/CD pipeline? You’re in the right place! In this post, we’ll walk through what CodeBuild is, how it works, and why it’s a powerful tool for modern developers.


**📦 What is AWS CodeBuild?**

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud, and a part of the AWS Developer Tools suite.


**Why use CodeBuild?**

✅ Serverless – No servers to provision or manage.

🔄 Scalable – Automatically scales to meet your build volume.

💰 Cost-effective – You pay only for the minutes your builds run.

🧪 CI/CD integration – Acts as a command line tool in your pipeline.


**How does it work?**

CodeBuild uses Docker containers to run build environments.

You can use:

- Prebuilt Docker images provided by AWS

- Your own Docker images from Docker Hub or Amazon ECR

Supported platforms: Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 2, and Windows Server Core


**🛠️ What is a Buildspec?**

A buildspec is a YAML file that tells CodeBuild how to run your build.


**Key features:**

It can be:

- Included in your source code repo (usually as buildspec.yml)

- Defined directly in the AWS Console

Contains instructions organized into phases:

- install

- pre_build

- build

- post_build

You can:

- Set runtime environments (in install phase)

- Define output artifacts

- Add environment variables as key-value pairs

- Integrate with Parameter Store and Secrets Manager

💡 Tip: Define environment variables in the project settings to reuse the same buildspec.yml across different environments or projects.


**🧰 Managing Build Projects**

Here’s what you can do with AWS CodeBuild:

- Add CodeBuild projects to your CI/CD pipelines

- Create standalone projects for one-off or reusable builds

- Schedule builds using AWS EventBridge or CloudWatch


**🔒 Security in CodeBuild**

AWS CodeBuild ensures your builds are secure by default:

🔐 Data-in-transit is encrypted with SSL and Signature Version 4

💾 Data-at-rest in Amazon S3 is encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) via AWS KMS

🔑 Access is controlled using AWS IAM

🤖 Pipelines use IAM service roles to run CodeBuild projects securely
