## What is CI/CD?

### Continuous Integration

In Conctinuous Integration (CI), developers commit the code changes frequently, several times a day, to the code repository.

In every code submission, automated builds and unit tests are run.

So Integration errors are detected earlier and can be eliminated before the deployment.
